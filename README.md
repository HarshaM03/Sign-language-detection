# ðŸ§  Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a Sign Language Detection system that can recognize hand gestures from images or video feeds using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to create an assistive tool that enables real-time communication between individuals using sign language and those who don't understand it.


## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time detection of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets (A-Z)
- Hand gesture recognition using image processing
- Trained on a dataset of labeled hand signs
- Live webcam inference support
- Easy integration with GUI or web interface
- Modular and extendable architecture
